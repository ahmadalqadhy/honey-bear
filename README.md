## About HoneyBear

Getting outdoors to adventoruos activities can be costly and buying gear with the possibilty of only using it a couple times per year doesn't sound appealing to some.  **honeybear** is an app that allows users to connect with others in their community to borrow, rent, and lend gear to each other.
