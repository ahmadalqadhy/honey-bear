## About HoneyBear

Getting outdoors to adventoruos activities can be costly and buying gear with the possibilty of only using it a couple times per year doesn't sound appealing to some.  **honeybear** is an app that allows users to connect with others in their community to borrow, rent, and lend gear to each other.

## Code Snippets

### Search Bar Backend JavaScript
```
router.get("/search", (req, res) => {
  let itemPattern = new RegExp(req.query.title, "i")
  Item.find({title:{$regex:itemPattern}})
    .then( items => {
      let userIds = items.map( item => item.user)
      User.find({_id: {$in: userIds}})  
        .then((users) => {
          res.json({items, users})})
        .catch((err) => res.status(404).json({ noitemssfound: "No items found" }));
    })
})
```
The axios call triggers the backend /search route which initiates a query to the MongoDB described by the userâ€™s input, further formatted by a regex and a case insensitivity parameter. Upon success, the promise then fires a second MongoDB query populating a users parameter based on the items array returned by the first query. The state is subsequently updated accordingly.
