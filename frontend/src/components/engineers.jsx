            <h4>Bryan Sillorequez</h4>
            <p>
              Bryan Sillorequez is a software engineer with an eye for design.
              Before software engineering, he was a photographer, which allows 
              him to apply his technical design background to create eye-catching
              apps with good functionality.  When he is not coding, you can find
              him thousands of feet up a rock face.
